        <h1><center><em>Szechuan Beef Noodle Soup</em></center></h1>
        <center><img src="./Images/szechuanbeef.jpg"></center>
        <center><p>Taiwanese beef noodle soup is a noodle soup dish originating from Taiwan. It is sometimes referred to as "Sichuan Beef Noodle Soup".
         The beef is often stewed with the broth and simmered, sometimes for hours.</p></center>
        <center><p>To begin with, Taiwanese Beef Noodle Soup is a delectable dish that warrants discussion. 
        This dish features succulent beef, a flavorful and mildly spicy broth, freshly made noodles, a touch of bok choy, and a mandatory serving of Chinese pickled mustard 
        greens, all topped off with scallions and cilantro. The resulting combination creates a harmonious blend of spiciness, savoriness, freshness, and saltiness, 
        resulting in a perfectly balanced and delicious bowl of soup.</p></center>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>3 pounds beef shank(1.4 kg, cut into 2-inch chunks)</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons oil</li>
            <li>A 2-inch piece of ginger (smashed)</li>
            <li>6 cloves garlic (smashed)</li>
            <li>3 scallions (cut into 2-inch segments)</li>
            <li>1 onion (cut into wedges)</li>
            <li>1 tomato (cut into wedges)</li>
            <li>4 dried chilies (ripped in half)</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon tomato paste</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons spicy bean paste douban jiang</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons sugar</li>
            <li>1/2 cup soy sauce</li>
            <li>1/2 cup Shaoxing wine</li>
            <li>8 cups water (to make the soup broth)</li>
            <li>1 Chinese aromatic herb packet</li>
            <li>32 ounces fresh wheat (white) noodles (900g)</li>
            <li>A small handful of bok choy for each serving</li>
            <li>Cilantro (finely chopped)</li>
            <li>Scallions (finely chopped)</li>
            <li>Pickled mustard greens</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Boil enough water in a pot to boil all of your beef. Once the water is boiling, add the beef. Let it come back up to a boil, and boil for 1 minute. 
            Strain in a colander and rinse thoroughly with fresh water to remove any impurities.</li>
            <li>Next, in your instant pot, turn on the saute setting. Add the oil, crushed ginger, garlic, scallions, and onions in that order.</li>
            <li>Stir to lightly caramelize. Let the onion turn translucent. Add the tomato and dried chilies.</li>
            <li>Next, add the meat to the pot. Then add the tomato paste, spicy bean paste (AKA doubanjiang), sugar, soy sauce, and Shaoxing wine. Mix thoroughly.</li>
            <li>To prepare the instant pot for cooking, start by pouring 8 cups of water into it. Next, add the packet of Chinese aromatic herbs (lu bao) to infuse the broth 
                with their unique flavors. Take care not to overfill the instant pot beyond the 10-cup line, as recommended for safety purposes. It's worth noting that if you're 
                using a smaller instant pot than the largest size (8 quarts) we're using, you can easily adjust the recipe by halving the ingredients accordingly.</li>
            <li>Once the instant pot is properly filled and prepared, seal the lid and ensure that the vent is not set to release. Set the Meat/Stew cooking mode for a duration 
                of 100 minutes. In the absence of an instant pot, you can opt to use a conventional stove pot. In this case, the soup should be simmered on low heat for approximately 
                3 hours.</li>
            <li>After the designated time has elapsed on the instant pot timer, it's important to exercise caution while releasing the pressure valve 
                (remember to wear an oven mitt to avoid scalding!). Then, proceed to boil the noodles according to the instructions provided on the package.</li>
            <li>And in the last minute or two of the noodles cooking, throw your bok choy in and blanch until just tender.</li>
            <li>To serve Taiwanese beef noodle soup, place a serving of noodles in each bowl, along with a few stalks of bok choy. Sprinkle each bowl generously with finely minced 
                cilantro, scallions, and Chinese pickled mustard greens for added flavor and texture.</li>
        </ol>
