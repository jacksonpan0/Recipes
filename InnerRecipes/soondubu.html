            <li>1½ tbsp garlic, minced</li>
            <li>1 pinch black pepper</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Soak frozen seafood in cold water until ice is melted, then drain well.</li>
            <li>Make the House Sauce, mix this sauce with the seafood and set aside.</li>
            <li>Wash and chop vegetables. Set aside.</li>
            <li>Begin by heating a medium-sized saucepan and adding sesame oil. Stir-fry the onion until it's partially cooked. 
            Then, add the pre-seasoned seafood mixture and stir-fry for roughly two minutes. Next, add water to the pan and cover it with a lid. 
            Once the water starts to boil, add in the zucchini, mushroom, and tofu. Allow the mixture to boil for about three to four minutes while the lid is still on. 
            Finally, taste the dish and add salt if necessary.</li>
            <li>After adding the egg, give the mixture a good stir. Then, turn off the heat but leave the pan on the stove for one to two minutes, 
            allowing the egg to cook through. Finally, sprinkle some scallions over the top and serve the dish hot.</li>
